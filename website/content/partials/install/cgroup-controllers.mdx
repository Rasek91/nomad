On Linux, Nomad uses cgroups to control access to resources like CPU and
memory. Nomad can support both [cgroups v2][] and the legacy [cgroups
v1][]. When Nomad clients start, they will determine the available cgroup
controllers and include the attribute `os.cgroups.version` in their
fingerprint.

Nomad can only use cgroups to control resources if all the required controllers
are available. If one or more required cgroups are unavailable, Nomad will
disable resource controls that require cgroups entirely. You will most often see
missing controllers on platforms used outside of datacenters, such as Raspberry
Pi or similar hobbyist computers.

On cgroups v2, you can verify that you have all required controllers as follows:

```shell-session
$ cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers
cpuset cpu io memory pids
```

On legacy cgroups v1, you can look for this same list of required controllers as
directories under the directory `/sys/fs/cgroup`.

To enable missing cgroups, add the appropriate boot command line arguments. For
example, to enable the `cpuset` cgroup, you'll need to add `cgroup_cpuset=1
cgroup_enable=cpuset`. These arguments should be added wherever specified by
your bootloader.

Refer to the documentation on [cgroup controller requirements][/nomad/docs/install/production/requirements#hardening-nomad] for more details.
